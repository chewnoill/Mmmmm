## Shaping your data. 

Probably the hardest part of building your graphql schema 
is defining the shape of your graph. There are two main 
approches, with their own complications and advantages: 

* modeling your data 
* and modeling your UI


### Modeling Data

Your GraphQL server doesn't need to be complicated. Do you 
have an existing database you want to expose with a Gql 
endpoint? Don't want to spend a ton of time thinking about 
you graph schema? Modeling your data is for you. 

### Modeling your UI

Do you want to lift complexity off your client?
